#Installation

Run 
```bash
npm install
```
inside the downloaded/cloned folder.

Run 
```bash
npm install
```
inside the student-ms-frontend (This is because React was segregated to a different part)

#UI Check

UI isn’t completed but, a layout is done, if you want to add your components, create
a new directory and link it to app.js file using React Router.

once done, make sure the state of auth is ‘true’ for you to view within the layout
(This is because authentication is still being done, once it’s done this process can be neglected)

Thanks
